=item action method

Action methods are typically used to perform transformations and
other actions while parsing a source code program.  Parse grammars
typically use the special token C< {*} > to indicate the point
at which an action method is to be invoked.  In addition, a line
containing C< {*} > may also use C< #= > to specify a "key" that
is to be passed to the action method.

=item NQP - Not Quite Perl

NQP is a primitive language for writing subroutines and methods
using a subset of the Perl 6 syntax.  It's not intended to be a
full-fledged programming language, nor does it provide a runtime
environment beyond the basic VM primitives.  Compilers typically
use NQP to compile "action methods" that convert a parse
tree into its equivalent abstract syntax tree representation.

=item Rakudo

Rakudo is the name of a Perl 6 implementation that runs on MoarVM and the JVM.
An abbreviation of "Rakuda-do," which, when translated from Japanese,
means "The Way of the Camel". In Japanese, "Rakudo" means "Paradise."
For more info, see L<http://use.perl.org/~pmichaud/journal/35400>.

=item STD.pm

STD.pm is the "standard" Perl 6 grammar definition,
see L<https://github.com/perl6/std/>.
At the moment STD.pm is not really a "specification" in a
proscriptive sense -- it's more of a guideline or model for
Perl 6 implementations to follow.  The goal is that eventually
the various implementations will converge on a common grammar
(that will probably look a lot like STD.pm).
